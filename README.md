The database has:
* galaxy
* star

tables. The purpose is to create simple database structure which should meet [Build a Celestial Bodies Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-celestial-bodies-database-project/build-a-celestial-bodies-database) project at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) platform.

## Installation
Run a postgres database on your machine. Connect to your postgres. Clone the **universe.sql** file. Open bash terminal, make sure that you are in the same directory with the **universe.sql** file, then run the command:
`$ psql -U postgres < universe.sql`. It should create the same structure of database and dump all the data.
